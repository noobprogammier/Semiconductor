# Semiconductor
> Semiconductor is a transistor is a transistor, which consists two
      numerical values which numerical values follows the base 2 numerical
      system. The first operation is to declear, wether the two items (1,0)
      is actually disjunction, which follows to mean 1 or 0 means it is 1
      . Then it comes to the conjuction, if it is 1 and 0, it will basically
      be 0. It is extremely easy to remember that kind of transistor. Then
      the next following operation is to guess, wether the number will be
      1(True) or 0(False). If the and value is 1, then it will be 0 and
      etcetera. You can use this program in order to speed up your process
      in solving all the items.
